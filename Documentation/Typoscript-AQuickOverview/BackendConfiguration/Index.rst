Backend Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TypoScript has influence in many different places. If TypoScript is
being used in the User/Usergroup TypoScript field or in the page
TypoScript field, it will change the looks and behavior of the forms
in the backend.

The frontend rendering is being defined by the TypoScript in the
TypoScript template. This document only handles the frontend rendering
part and only with TypoScript in general.
