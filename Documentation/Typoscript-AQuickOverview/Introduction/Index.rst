Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The goal of this introduction is not the thought, "Finally it's
working!", but, "Finally I grasped it!". In other words, this
introduction is to give you a comprehension of how TypoScript works.
Normally, one adds some arbitrary properties to objects; but, for
someone who knows TypoScript, it is clear that such a practice won´t
work like that. It saves time to know what goes on. That way,
troubleshooting becomes easier and time is economized as one learns
TypoScript. Everything else is just luck.

The goal of this introduction is not to have a running TYPO3
installation at the end, but to offer an explanation why it works.
