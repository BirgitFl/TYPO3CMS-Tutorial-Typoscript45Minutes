The data type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While TypoScripting, it's crucial to know what kind of datatype we are
handling. Especially with stdWrap, we have noticed it's becoming
common practice to combine functions arbitrarily, until the
anticipated result is achieved by accident.

Only if the stdWrap functionality is mentioned explicitly, the stdWrap
functions like field, data, or typolink can be used.
