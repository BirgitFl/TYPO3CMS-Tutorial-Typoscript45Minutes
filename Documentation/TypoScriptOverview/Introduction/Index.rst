Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The goal of this introduction is not to leave you  with the thought,
"Finally, it's working!", but with the thought of "Finally, I get it!".
In other words, this introduction is designed to give you a
comprehensive understanding of how TypoScript works.

A common TYPO3 workflow used by beginners is to try arbitrary
properties to objects until things somehow begin to work. Understanding
TypoScript allows you to work more quickly and effectively, and working
with TYPO3 becomes more productive and less of a strain. Troubleshooting
is easier and time is saved by learning TypoScript. Otherwise you are
dependent on luck and accident.

The goal of this introduction is not to have a running TYPO3
installation at the end, but to offer an explanation of *why* and *how*
TypoScript works.
