Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The goal of this introduction is not to leave you with the thought,
"It's finally working!", but with the thought of "Finally, I know HOW it works!".
In other words, this introduction is designed to give you a
comprehensive understanding of how TypoScript works.

A common TYPO3 workflow used by beginners is to try arbitrary
properties to objects until things somehow begin to work. Understandin how TypoScript works, 
however, allows you to work more quickly and more efficiently with TYPO3 and becomes more productive and less of
a strain. Troubleshooting is easier and time is saved by learning
TypoScript properly. Otherwise, you are dependent on luck and chance. In a more vernacular tone, it would be a "hit-or-miss" technique.

The goal of this introduction is not to have a running TYPO3
installation at the end, but to offer an explanation of *why* and *how*
TypoScript works. 

Understanding this tutorial is important for other ones. An example is the "Templating Tutorial: Basics". Understanding this tutorial, TypoScript in 45 Minutes, is foundational
