The data type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While TypoScripting, it is crucial to know what kind of data type we
are handling. Especially with stdWrap, we have noticed that people
sometimes try to combine functions arbitrarily, until the anticipated
result is finally achieved by accident.

Only if the stdWrap functionality is mentioned explicitly, the stdWrap
functions like field, data, or typolink can actually be used.

Check the :ref:`TypoScript reference <t3tsref:start>`, if you are
unsure!
